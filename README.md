This is a codecademy project.

I am hereby adding a README.md file


BUILDING INTERACTIVE WEBSITES
ASCII Portfolio
ASCII art is art made from only the letters, numbers and symbols you can type on your keyboard.

In this project, you’ll use Git backtracking commands to undo mistakes made to an ASCII art portfolio!

If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced developer work through it, click “Get Unstuck“ to see a project walkthrough video.
